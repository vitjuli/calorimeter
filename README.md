# Calorimeter Energy Resolution Analysis

*A statistical study of detector response modelling using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, profile likelihoods, and resampling methods.*

---

## Overview

This repository presents a rigorous statistical analysis of **calorimeter energy resolution**, a central problem in experimental particle physics. The goal is to characterise the energy-dependent response of a particle detector — its bias, resolution, and noise contributions — using a hierarchy of statistical estimation approaches, from sample statistics through to a global simultaneous likelihood fit.

The study compares the statistical properties of several estimation frameworks and quantifies parameter uncertainties via both asymptotic (Hessian) errors and exact resampling methods.

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset of $(E_\text{true},\ E_\text{rec})$ pairs from a particle detector simulation, the measured reconstruction follows:

$$E_\text{rec} \mid E_0 \sim \mathcal{N}\!\left(\mu(E_0),\ \sigma(E_0)\right)$$

The response is modelled by two parametric functions:

**Mean (bias) model:**
$$\mu(E_0) = \lambda E_0 + \Delta$$

**Resolution model** (standard calorimeter parametrisation):
$$\frac{\sigma(E_0)}{E_0} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2}{E_0} + \frac{b^2}{E_0^2} + c^2}$$

| Parameter | Physical interpretation |
|-----------|------------------------|
| $\lambda$ | Energy scale (gain calibration) |
| $\Delta$  | Constant offset (pedestal / electronic noise) |
| $a$       | Stochastic (sampling) term $\propto 1/\sqrt{E}$ |
| $b$       | Noise term $\propto 1/E$ |
| $c$       | Constant systematic floor |

## Statistical Methods

### 1. Sample Estimators
Per-energy-slice sample mean and standard deviation, with analytical error propagation. Linear and resolution trends are extracted via **Least Squares** fitting using `iminuit`.

### 2. Individual Unbinned MLE
For each energy slice, an **unbinned Gaussian NLL** is minimised independently using `iminuit` (MIGRAD + HESSE). Parameters and uncertainties are compared against sample estimates.

### 3. Simultaneous Global Fit
A single **global NLL** is constructed over all events jointly, fitting $(\lambda, \Delta, a, b, c)$ simultaneously without intermediate aggregation. This is statistically more efficient and avoids information loss from per-slice compression.

### 4. Profile Likelihood & Confidence Contours
1D profile likelihoods $\Delta \text{NLL}(\theta_i)$ and 2D confidence contours (via `mnprofile` / `mncontour`) are computed for all five detector parameters, providing exact likelihood-based confidence intervals beyond Gaussian approximation.

### 5. Jackknife Resampling
Bias-corrected jackknife estimates of mean and standard deviation are computed per energy using the `resample` package, providing a non-parametric cross-check on uncertainties.

### 6. Non-Parametric Bootstrap Comparison
A full-analysis bootstrap ($n = 2500$ replicas) propagates statistical uncertainty end-to-end through all three estimation pipelines, enabling a direct comparison of their variance and consistency:
- Sample estimates + LS trend fits
- Per-energy MLE + trend fits
- Simultaneous fit
